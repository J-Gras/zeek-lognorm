Bro::Lognorm
============

This plugin aims at integrating liblognorm into Bro and is under development.

Installation
------------

The plugin is based on liblognorm_, which requires libfastjson_. Make sure both
libraries are available including their headers, which are required to build this
plugin. The following will then compile and install the Lognorm plugin alongside
Bro, assuming it can find the headers in a standard location::

    # ./configure && make && make install

If the headers are installed somewhere non-standard, add
``--with-liblognorm=<liblognorm-header-directory>`` respectively
``--with-libfastjson=<libfastjson-header-directory>`` to the ``configure``
command. If everything built and installed correctly, you should see
this::

    # bro -N Bro::Lognorm
	Bro::Lognorm - Log file analyzing (in development) (dynamic, version 0.2)

Usage
-----

The plugin wraps basic liblognorm functionality by providing the ``lognorm`` opaque
type. This type allows to parse log lines based on liblognorm rule files. In case a
rule matches, an event for every tag the rule defines is scheduled. To handle these,
one needs to define an event with the corresponding name. This event may specify any
subset of fields, parsed by the rule, as arguments. Fields are mapped to arguments
by name.

The plugin comes with a small set of scripts that allow easy integration. For more
details see ``scripts/Bro/Lognorm/``.

Notes
-----

 - The plugin is not well tested!
 - Currently liblognorm seems to provide every value as string. Thus there is no
   implicit conversion to Bro types like ``count`` or ``double``.
 - The plugin does not support nested types (might be implemented on demand).
 - If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out!
